all.* are generated by concatenating ORBs, 14 per state x 9 states = 88 orbitals. see pyscf/analyze/collect_mos.py
optjast3 is optimized on the ground state, see vmc_eq/base/gs0.linear.*
s12.sys is the sys file for Sz=1/2 states, identical to gs0.sys from vmc_eq/req_files
s32.sys is the sys file for Sz=3/2 states, identical to gs2.sys from vmc_eq/req_files
b3lyp_iao_b.* files are IAOs built on orbitals 1-14 for gs0-gs5, see pyscf/analyze/build_iao
